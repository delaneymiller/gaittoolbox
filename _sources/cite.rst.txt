Citation
============

When citing the Gait Toolbox, please cite the original paper where the specific algorithm of interest was first reported, so that contributors of new algorithms get their fair share of citations. For example, the algorithm *Constrainted Kalman filter for reduced sensor configaration* :cite:`sy2019ckf` can be cited as follows:

Luke Sy, Michael Raitor, Michael Del Rosario, Heba Khamis, Lauren Kark, Nigel H. Lovell, and Stephen J. Redmond. Estimating lower limb kinematics using a reduced wearable sensor count. 2019.
