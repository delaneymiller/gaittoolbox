# Gait Reconstruction Toolbox

Refer to the [documentation](https://gait-tech.github.io/gaittoolbox/) for more details.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository 
	```
	git clone https://github.com/gait-tech/gaittoolbox.git
	```
2. Run the following command to initialize submodules
	```
	git submodule update --init --recursive
	```
3. *OPTIONAL but required library to generate c3d files.* Download the btk toolbox for MATLAB [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/b-tk/downloads) (e.g., btk-0.3.0_Win7_MatlabR2009b_64bit.zip). Export to a directory and add the said directory to the MATLAB path [tutorial here](https://au.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html).

## Update
1. Pull this repository and submodules
	```
	git pull
	git submodule update --remote --merge
	```

## Documentation and Tutorial

## How to cite the Gait Toolbox

When citing the Gait Toolbox, please cite the original paper where an algorithm was first reported, so that contributors of new algorithms get their fair share of citations. For example, the algorithm *Constrainted Kalman filter for reduced sensor configaration* can be cited as follows:

	[1] Luke Sy, Michael Raitor, Michael Del Rosario, Heba Khamis, Lauren Kark, Nigel H. Lovell, Stephen J. Redmond (2019). Estimating Lower Limb Kinematics using a Reduced Wearable Sensor Count. Pre-print.

=======
## How to start
1. Install MATLAB 2018a (there are basic functions that uses the newest library)
1. Run runAllTCD.m, runAllXsens.m, OR runAllNeuRA.m (not yet ready)
1. To run UKF based algorithms, refer to UKF_validate_cukf_v9.m or similar files

## Datasets
### Total Capture Dataset
1. Download from [link](https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/z5151460_ad_unsw_edu_au/EeKUGznFC3tAjUneixJmh64B93ozvw5uKnYt9gl2KecDxw?e=EjeVeP). Please do not forget to cite the reference paper [details](http://cvssp.org/data/totalcapture/)
1. Extract zip file to the code root folder. It should produce a folder named 'totalcapture' with subdirectories 'gyroMag', 'imu', and 'vicon'.
